<p>Hi, I'm Nathan Hay. I'm 20-year-old harpist studying music theory at The Ohio State University.</p>
<h2 id="content">Training</h2>
<p><span class="image right" style="max-height:15%; max-width:15%;"><img src="{% link assets/images/casual_headshot.jpg %}" alt=""/></span>I prefaced my harp instruction with piano lessons, studying with Dr. Suzanne Newcomb of Otterbein University, and supplementing my piano experience with jazz studies at The Wellington School. After some piano training, I began to study the harp with Professor Jeanne Norton. I study the technique of Carlos Salzedo, focusing on the values of technical precision and quality of sound. My training also includes masterclasses with artists such as Florence Sitruk of Indiana University and Yolanda Kondanasis of the Oberlin Conservatory. I have also worked with artists and ensembles at the past three National Harp Conventions ('14, '16, '18).</p>
<h2 id="content">Experience</h2>
<p>I have always valued the utility of the harp in many settings, and endeavor to constantly explore new paths of not just solo playing, but orchestral and ensemble playing as well. My solo experience includes (but is not limited to):
	<ul>
		<li>Recitic playing</li>
		<li>Dinners/light entertainment</li>
		<li>Weddings and receptions</li>
		<li>Private parties</li>
	</ul>
Additionally, I have extensive ensemble experience, and have appeared with groups such as:
	<ul>
		<li>The New Albany Symphony Orchestra (Principal, '15-'21)</li>
		<li>The Ohio State University Wind Symphony ('17-'21)</li>
		<li>The Ohio State University Symphony Orchestra ('17-'19)</li>
		<li>The Heisey Wind Ensemble (Principal, '17-18)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
